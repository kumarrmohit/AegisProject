# Aegisproject
here is some feature i have given in this project, mentioning below:-
    => A user can sign-up(resgister) by users/register and after that can sign-in by users/login .
    => After login only user can check the flight details , if without login user will try to check flight details 
     so site will tell customer to login first 

     for eg: {
              "msg": "Please login"
             }

    =>when user will login by localhost:3000/register then by the data of email and passsword customer can login ,by      localhost:3000/users/login

    for eg:-{
             email:"mohit@gmail.com"
             password:"$2b$05$b.2lT1N.Bh.WbFxYcB0G1umK3myTbtAr3ypw/yLfgJXrbyYyhTcpm"
            }

    =>after this checking on localhost:3000/flights/, api will show there of flights data

    =>and by this , http://localhost:3000/flights/delhi/jaipur/2023-05-16,   we can check flight data and price data along with airline between two stations
